### Installation (via Composer) (recommended)
Add the following to the composer.json of your TYPO3 installation
```
"repositories": [
    { "type": "vcs", "url": "git@github.com:mautic/mautic-typo3.git" }
	],
require {
    "mautic/mautic-typo3": "^1.3"
}
```

    $ composer install
    
Go into the TYPO3 backend to the Extensions module and enable the 'Mautic' extension

### Installation (without composer)

When retrieving the file from TER you can install this file using the extension manager.

If you want to build the latest master you need to create the extension zip file:
